        "storyText": "The project started after several trips where Jade realized she had taken part in activities that were harmful to the ocean: too many boats around animals, corals stepped on, unclear practices… This sparked a core question: how can we help travelers choose more respectful experiences? Jade then presented GuardianMap at the Altern’Up competition and reached the final. Even without winning, it strengthened the drive to keep going. She brought Thomas into the adventure—after working together on previous projects—to build a tool useful for both travelers and committed local operators.",

        "commitText": "We select activities using clear criteria: recognized labels, trained teams, respect for wildlife, limited boat numbers, traveler education… GuardianMap isn’t a showcase of everything—it’s a filter to spotlight the operators who truly make efforts to protect the ocean."
